    <h2>This is my project to graduate from HTML</h2>

    <h3>This website showcases some of the Python projects I developed while studying on the Algorithmics platform. I graduated from Algorithmics in Python, and I created this site so people can explore and try out what I've built.</h3>

    <h4>How can you run my code on your machine?</h4>
    <h5>
      • First, the user needs to download and install Visual Studio Code on their device.<br>
      • Next, they should install the Python language on their system.<br>
      • Then, they can go to the Extensions section in Visual Studio Code and add the Python extension from there.<br>
      • After setting everything up, they can paste your code into Visual Studio Code.<br>
      • Finally, they just run the code, and it will work smoothly on their machine.
